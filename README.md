# 🧘 satibot: The Mindful AI Agent Framework

Built in Zig for performance, designed for awareness.

`satibot` is a lightweight, memory-aware AI agent framework that never forgets. Inspired by [OpenClawd](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot), it combines the power of ReAct loops with persistent memory to create agents that remember, learn, and assist.

IMPORTANT: Currently, it only supports Openrouter (LLM provider), Telegram and console, other features are under development.

- [x] Telegram + OpenRouter (Sync version)
- [x] Console
- [x] chat history saved to JSON base session file, start new session with `/new` message
- [x] VectorDB - very simple local first vector searching for similar content chat logs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install

Install Zig: <https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/>

```bash
# verify zig version
zig version
# 0.15.2

git clone https://github.com/satibot/satibot.git
cd satibot

# build
zig build
# or
make build

# initialize `~/.bots/config.json` (at HOME path)
# If platform sections already exists, it will do nothing
# default config is:
# - using `arcee-ai/trinity-large-preview:free`
# - using `openrouter`
# - using `telegram`
satibot in
```

### 2. Configure

Read [docs/TELEGRAM_GUIDE.md](docs/TELEGRAM_GUIDE.md) for more details about Telegram + OpenRouter setup.

Edit `~/.bots/config.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "arcee-ai/trinity-large-preview:free"
    }
  },
  "providers": {
    "openrouter": {
      "apiKey": "sk-or-v1-xxx"
    }
  },
  "tools": {
    "telegram": {
      "botToken": "",
      "chatId": ""
    }
  }
}
```

Add `satibot` to your PATH, for example add to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="/Users/your-username/chatbot/satibot/zig-out/bin:$PATH"
```

## Run

```bash
# for console, terminal base
satibot console

# for telegram (sync version - simple & reliable)
satibot telegram-sync

# TODO
# for telegram (async version - high performance)
# satibot telegram
```

### Telegram Bot Versions

satibot offers two Telegram bot implementations:

**🔄 Sync Version** (`telegram-sync`)

- Simple, reliable, single-threaded
- Processes one message at a time
- Lower resource usage (~1MB on macOS M1)
- Text messages only (no voice support)
- Best for: development, small deployments, resource-constrained environments

**⚡ Async Version** (`telegram`)

TODO

- High-performance, event-driven
- Processes multiple messages concurrently
- Higher resource usage - RAM usage ~3.5MB on macOS M1

See [docs/TELEGRAM_SYNC_VS_ASYNC.md](docs/TELEGRAM_SYNC_VS_ASYNC.md) for detailed comparison.

## 🛠️ Advanced Features

### 🧠 Memory System

- **VectorDB**: Semantic search across conversations
- **GraphDB**: Relationship mapping for complex knowledge
- **RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for accurate responses
- **Session Cache**: In-memory session history with automatic cleanup (30 minutes idle timeout)

### 📚 VectorDB

🎯 Perfect For Chat Logs:

- Semantic Search: Find similar conversations by meaning, not just keywords
- Local First: No external database dependencies
- Fast Enough: Linear search suitable for thousands of entries
- Auto-indexing: Already integrated with conversation indexing

- **Storage**: `~/.bots/vector_db.json`
- **Usage**:

```bash
satibot vector-db stats
satibot vector-db list
satibot vector-db search "your query" [top_k]
satibot vector-db add "my name is John"
```

### 🔧 Skills & Tools

TODO

```bash
# Browse available skills
curl https://agent-skills.md/

# Install a new skill
./scripts/install-skill.sh <github-url-or-path>

# Use built-in tools
zig build run -- agent -m "Run: ls -la"
```

### ⏰ Automation

TODO

```bash
# Heartbeat: Proactive task checking
echo "Check emails" > HEARTBEAT.md

# Cron: Schedule recurring tasks
zig build run -- cron --schedule "0 9 * * *" --message "Daily summary"
```

## 📖 The Meaning of Sati

**Sati** (Pāli) means "mindful awareness" — the art of not forgetting the present moment - "remembering to stay aware of what is happening right now.".

In Buddhist psychology, sati evolved from simple memory to profound awareness:

- Remember you are breathing
- Remember thoughts are arising
- Remember what is happening now

**SatiBot embodies this principle:**

- 🧠 Never forgets context or conversations
- 📍 Tracks state consistently across sessions
- 👁️ Stays aware of ongoing processes
- 🌊 Never loses events in the flow

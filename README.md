# 🧘 satibot: The Mindful AI Agent Framework

Built in Zig for performance, designed for awareness.
`satibot` is a lightweight, memory-aware AI agent framework that never forgets. Inspired by [OpenClawd](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot), it combines the power of ReAct loops with persistent memory to create agents that remember, learn, and assist.

IMPORTANT: This project is currently migrating to **Zig 0.16.0**.
- [x] Telegram + OpenRouter (Sync version)
- [x] Console
- [x] chat history saved to JSON base session file, start new session with `/new` message
- [x] VectorDB - very simple local first vector searching for similar content chat logs.
- [x] GraphDB - Relationship mapping and entity persistence
- [x] Subagent Spawning - Delegate complex tasks to child agents
- [x] OpenTelemetry tracing for observability
- [x] HTTP Web API (zap framework) for REST interface built on top of the Zap logging library (used for fast, structured logging)
- [x] [apps/music/README.md](apps/music/README.md) - MiniMax music generation CLI
- [x] File operations - built-in `read_file` tool for reading local files with security restrictions
- [x] Web fetching - built-in `web_fetch` tool for fetching and extracting readable content from URLs

## CLI Options

### Agent Command Options

When using `sati agent`, you can use these options:
```bash
# Disable RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
sati agent --no-rag

# Single message with RAG disabled
sati agent -m "Hello, how are you?" --no-rag

# Interactive mode with specific session and RAG disabled
sati agent -s chat123 --no-rag
```

### Telegram Bot Versions

satibot offers two Telegram bot implementations:
🔄 Sync Version (`s-telegram-sync`)

- Simple, reliable, single-threaded
- Processes one message at a time
- Lower resource usage (~1MB on macOS M1)
- Text messages only (no voice support)
- Best for: development, small deployments, resource-constrained environments

⚡ Async Version (`s-telegram`)
- High-performance, event-driven (xev-based)
- Processes multiple messages concurrently
- Higher resource usage - RAM usage more than 3.5MB on macOS M1 (disable RAG with `--no-rag` option)

See [docs/TELEGRAM_SYNC_VS_ASYNC.md](docs/TELEGRAMSYNCVS_ASYNC.md) for detailed comparison.

### 🔧 Skills & Tools

Browse and install skills from the community:
```bash
# Browse available skills
curl https://agent-skills.md/

# Install a new skill
./scripts/install-skill.sh <github-url-or-path>

# Use built-in tools
zig build s-console -- -- agent -m "Run: ls -la"
```

#### Built-in Tools

🧠 GraphDB - Persistent memory for entities and relationships
The agent can map out concepts and remember relationships over time using:
- `graph_add_node`: Register entities or concepts.
- `graph_add_edge`: Map relationships between entities.
- `graph_query`: Explore the knowledge graph.
- `graph_delete_node` / `graph_delete_edge`: Manage and clean memory.

🤖 spawn_subagent - Task delegation
Delegate sub-tasks to a child agent with specific instructions.

📁 read_file - Read local files
The `read_file` tool allows the AI agent to read contents of local files on your system.

Usage Examples:
```bash
# Ask the agent to read a file
sati console-sync
> Please read the contents of /home/user/config.txt

# Read and analyze a log file
> Can you read /var/log/system.log and summarize any errors?

# Read a code file
> Read the main.zig file and explain what it does
```

Arguments:
- `path` (required): Absolute or relative path to the file to read

Example JSON:
```json
{
  "path": "/path/to/your/file.txt"
}
```

Features:
- ✅ Supports text files of any size (10MB limit)
- ✅ Handles absolute and relative paths
- ✅ Proper error handling for missing files
- ✅ Built-in security restrictions for sensitive files
- ✅ Memory-efficient with automatic cleanup

Security Restrictions:
For security reasons, the tool automatically blocks access to sensitive files:

- Environment files: `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*` variations
- Private keys: `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, `private_key.*`, `*.key`
- Credentials: `credentials.*`, `secret.*`
- Sensitive directories: `.ssh/`, `.aws/`, `.kube/`

Examples of blocked files:
- `.env` ❌
- `id_rsa` ❌
- `private_key.pem` ❌
- `.ssh/config` ❌
- `config.txt` ✅
- `public_key.pem` ✅
- `data.json` ✅

🌐 web_fetch - Fetch web content
See [docs/tasks/web-fetch.md](docs/tasks/web-fetch.md) for detailed documentation.

### ⏰ Automation

Heartbeat: Proactive task checking
```bash
# Create a heartbeat task
echo "Check emails" > ~/.bots/HEARTBEAT.md

# Run the telegram bot (includes heartbeat)
sati telegram

Cron: Schedule recurring tasks
```bash
zig build run-cron -- --schedule "0 9 * * *" --message "Daily summary"
# or after build:
./zig-out/bin/s-cron --schedule "0 9 * * *" --message "Daily summary"
```

## 📖 The Meaning of Sati

Sati (Pāli) means "mindful awareness" — the art of not forgetting the present moment - "remembering to stay aware of what is happening right now.".
In Buddhist psychology, sati evolved from simple memory to profound awareness:

- Remember you are breathing
- Remember thoughts are arising
- Remember what is happening now

SatiBot embodies this principle:
- Never forgets context or conversations
- Tracks state consistently across sessions
- Stays aware of ongoing processes
- Never loses events in the flow
